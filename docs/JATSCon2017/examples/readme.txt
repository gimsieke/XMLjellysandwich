In this file:

_A_EpMic-201612-rough.html
_B_EpMic-201612-sectioned.html
_C_EpMic-201612-roughBITS.xml

were all produced via XProc/XSLT operating over (originally) .docx input.

The first step was produced using XSweet (see http://gitlab.org/wendell/XSweet) with
configurations for this project.

Subsequent steps (producing B and C outputs) were assembled or written for this conversion
using XSLT and XProc (in Saxon/XMLCalabash/oXygen).

then file _C_EpMic-201612-roughBITS.xml was edited by hand
(in a structured editor) to produce _Z_EpigramMicrophonexml.
These included numerous changes to content (by the author)
as well as enhancements or corrections to the markup.
