# XML Jelly Sandwich Demos

XML Jelly Sandwich is a library of XSLTs you can use to create XML/XSLT applications using SaxonJS. These will run in most any modern browser with Javascript.

The demonstrations, and XML Jelly Sandwich in general, are entirely dependent on SaxonJS and would have been impossible without the efforts of Michael Kay, [Saxonica](http://saxonica.com) and [oXygen XML IDE](http://oxygenxml.com).

Each of the demonstrations listed is provided with source XSLT, if you know where to find it or how to ask.
