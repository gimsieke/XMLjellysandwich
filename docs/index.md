# XML Jelly Sandwich Demos

There are only some of those I have made. Others too.

Each of these is provided with source XSLT, if you know where to find it or how to ask. 

* W.B. Yeats' [Irish Airman (an SVG rendering)](http:pellucidliterature.org/IrishAirman)
* Rob't Southey's [Thalaba](http://pellucidliterature.org/Thalaba) in TEI encoding
* [Epigram Microphone](http://pausepress.net/EpigramMicrophone), by Mark Scott
* [JATSCon presentation slides](JATSCon2017)
* [Balisage Upconversion Workshop paper/slides](Balisage2017/workshop-slides.html)
* [Balisage SaxonJS slides](Balisage2017/balisage2017-slides.html)
* [Balisage SaxonJS final paper](Balisage2017/balisage2017-final.html)

Thalaba demo calls a file in a fork of E Beshero-Bandar's TEI Thalaba. Thanks Elisa!

Note that the demonstrations were all made at various times using different generations of tools available at github.com/wendellpiez/XMLjellysandwich. Each has subsequently undergone more or less radical refactoring. However, in many cases they were also abandoned as soon as a project was due, so they may be kind of a mess.
